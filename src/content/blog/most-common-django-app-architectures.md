Django, a high-level Python Web framework, encourages clean, pragmatic design and provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools to build both simple and complex web applications. Here are some of the most common architectures employed in Django app development:

Monolithic Architecture: This is the traditional architecture for Django projects. Django's apps are designed to be reusable, which promotes modularity within a monolithic architecture. However, the term "monolithic" does not necessarily mean the application has to be large or unwieldy. It's monolithic in the sense that it runs in a single process.

Microservices Architecture: This architecture is designed around the idea that several small, independently deployable software systems are easier to create and maintain than a single large software system. Django can be used to create these small systems. While Django itself was not specifically designed for this purpose, it is flexible enough to accommodate a microservices architecture.

Distributed Architecture: A single Django application can be spread across multiple servers to handle a larger load. This could involve separating the database onto a separate server, or having multiple servers handle web requests.

Serverless Architecture: Django can be run in a serverless environment such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. However, this is less common because Django is a fairly large framework and it's more suited to long-running server processes. But with specific configurations and the help of tools such as Zappa or Serverless framework, you can use Django in a serverless architecture.

Decoupled (or Headless) Architecture: In this architecture, the Django backend provides an API (usually with Django Rest Framework) that is consumed by a separate frontend application (React, Angular, Vue, etc.). This allows the frontend and backend to be developed and scaled independently.

Hybrid Architecture: A hybrid approach can also be taken where parts of the application use a monolithic style, other parts use microservices, and yet others are serverless or decoupled.
